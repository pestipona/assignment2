# Question 2: How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by anyone) so far?

9 commits have been made to the repository

# Question 2: Write the git command you used to get this information

git log

# Question 3: When was the README.md file modified last? Write the git command you used to get this information

Wed Feb 21 13:24:00 2024 -0500

git log -1 README.md

# Question 4: Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository

The first reason branches are used in a Git repository is to allow developers to work on developing new code
in a feature branch without affecting the main branch. This isolates the changes they make in the feature branch without
affecting the main branch.

The second reason branches are used in a Git repository is to allow collaboration among developers to write code
especially for a big project. This allows developers to work in parallel with other developers and write their own code
on their own branches without affecting others, and at the end of their work can merge with other branches or the main branch.

# Question 5: What is the difference between git log and git status?

The difference is in the output and use of each command. Git log is used more for tracking the history of the repository.
Git log outputs a list of past commits made in the repository with details such as the date, time, author, and commit
message. Whereas git status is used more in checking the current state of the repository.  Git status outputs what your
current branch is, if your branch is up to date with 'origin/master', which files are staged for the next commit, and
which files are untracked by git.

# Question 6: What command would you use to see the commits where “Vehicle.h” was one of the committed files?

git log --follow Vehicle.h

# Question 7: What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message contains the word “file”?

git log --grep="file" -i

# Question 8: In the context of object-oriented programming:

    ## (I) What is inheritance?

    Inheritance is a concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where a new class known as a derived class,
    is created from a more general form of a class known as the base class. The derived class has all the member variables
    and member functions of the base class, and can have additional member variables and member functions. Making it a
    specialized class. The derived class forms an "Is a" relationship of the base class, which can be thought of the child
    and the base class as the parent.

    ## (II) What is polymorphism?

    Polymorphism is a concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where any data such as a function can be processed
    in more than one form. It comes from the greek word "poly" meaning many, and "morph" meaning change. There are
    two types of polymorphism, the first is Static Polymorphism (Compile-Time Polymorphism) and the second one is
    Dynamic Polymorphism (Run-Time Polymorphism).

    In Static Polymorphism a common example is method overloading, where multiple methods in a class have the same
    name but different method signatures, such as different number and types of parameters. This is processed during
    compile time, where the compiler can determine which method to execute based on the method's signature.

    In Dynamic Polymorphism the correct method is determined during runtime based on the object instance by means
    of using virtual functions. This is also referred to as late binding or dynamic binding. Because the compiler doesn't
    know how what virtual function will be implemented, only when the object instance is used in the program during
    run time will the compiler know the correct implementation to use.

    ### (III) What is encapsulation?

    Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) where data such as attributes and their methods are
    combined or bundled together into a single unit such as a class. Which makes it easier to use and has some other
    benefits such as "information hiding" where  private variables are only accessible via the public methods defined
    in the class. It also enables "abstraction" where the users don't see the inner workings of the class or how the
    attributes are implemented, all the users see are the data being passed into the class and what is returned.

# Question 9: What is the main difference between the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow and the “Integration manager” workflow?

# Question 10: How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow?
